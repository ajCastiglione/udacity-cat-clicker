## Premium Cat Clicker (Mock project for Udacity)
This is a simple game based on <a href="https://cowclicker.com/">cow clicker</a>

## How to play
<ul>
<li>Click "Clone in Desktop" / "Download ZIP"</li>
<li>Open the folder</li>
<li>Open index.html on your preferred browser</li>
<li>It will show a vertical menu of cat images on the left</li>
</ul>

Choose a cat (by clicking on it) from the 5 available and proceed to click on the larger picture that will appear on the right hand side on desktop, on mobile it will be underneath the menu.

## How it works
The cat names, imgs, and urls are stored in a array of anonymous objects.

I assign an id (which is equal to the object's index in the array) to each cat so it remains scalable.

I use the cat's id to grab that object from the array to then update the amount of clicks.

## Future of this project
I plan on updating this project with more features such as:
<ul>
<li>Being able to add your own cat.</li>
<li>Being able to rename any given cat.</li>
<li>Actually spending time styling this and making it look better.</li>
</ul>
